You can sanitize the input to reject symbols like `<` and `>`.

But the most important thing to do is to protect the injection when you write the text.
If you use
 - div.innerText, the <script> tag will be displayed.
 - div.innerHtml, the <script> will appened to the code and will be executed.
Most of the frameworks, like React.JS, Vue, Angular, ... will protect you against XSS injections.
