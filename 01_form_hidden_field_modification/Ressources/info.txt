Note: While the value is not displayed to the user in the page's content,
it is visible (and can be edited) using any browser's developer tools or
"View Source" functionality. Do not use hidden inputs as a form of security!

Modifying an hidden input field allows to change the intent of the form,
in this specific case, it would allow whatever informations is meant to be
sent to webmaster@borntosec.com to be redirected to the email of your choice
instead.
