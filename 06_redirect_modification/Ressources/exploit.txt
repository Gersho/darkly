footer has redirects for social media in the form of
http://192.168.1.16/index.php?page=redirect&site=facebook

modification of the site argument allows to change destination ?
specifics unknown since any change to the site argument leads to the flag page
how is the rest of the url filled for a complete attack ?

assuming we can redirect to a page of our choice, the following exploit is possible:
the site itself is not compromised, you aim at users of the site
for exemple you could make a phishing attemps sending the users links that
would look like they are on the legitimate site, but are redirect to a look alike
site of your making to trick them into entenring their credentials
