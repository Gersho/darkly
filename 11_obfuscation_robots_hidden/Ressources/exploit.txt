from robots.txt we learn about the /.hidden path

there's a bunch of folders within folders

(each folder had 26 subfolders starting with a different letter, good path is maybe a key by itself ?)

dump everything in that folder
lftp -c "open http://192.168.1.16/.hidden; mirror"
(dump is 143Mo so is not included in repo)

search in folder for "flag" (in a more "real" context you would want to check every file and/or look for specific file names and/or extensions)
in path: /hidden_dump/whtccjokayshttvxycsvykxcfm/igeemtxnvexvxezqwntmzjltkt/lmpanswobhwcozdqixbowvbrhw/README
(so the "key" was "wil")

Hey, here is your flag : d5eec3ec36cf80dce44a896f961c1831a05526ec215693c8f2c39543497d4466
