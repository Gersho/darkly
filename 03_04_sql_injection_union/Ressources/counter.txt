The data to search in a sql query should always be binded 
For example:
 - $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = :name')
then bind :name to the name you want to search
 - $stmt->execute([ 'name' => $name ]);

Using string concatenation is dangerous, for example
 - 'SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = ' . $name
if the name is
 "aa OR 1 = 1", all the employees will be fetched.
